# backend

The backend comprises the following parts:
- API: the API reached by the frontend
- Database: the declaration and repositories to interact with the database

The API documentation can be reached at the following addresses: 
- `localhost:3000/ui` for a human-friendly format üßê
- `localhost:3000/doc` for a harder to read format ü§ñ

To install dependencies (at the root of the backend folder):

```bash
bun install
```

To run in development mode(at the root of the backend folder):
```bash
bun dev
```

To dos:
- protect API behind authentication
- change hard-coded connection strings to environment-based declarations
- Add endpoint end-to-end testing
- Add migration and seeding scripts for the database

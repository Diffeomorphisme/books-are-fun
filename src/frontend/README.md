A very very very simple frontend adapted from a bun-templated project for a Nextjs app.

The only file modified from the template is the /app/page.tsx file.

To install dependencies(at the root of the frontend folder):

```bash
bun install
```

To run in development mode (at the root of the frontend folder):
```bash
bun dev
```

To dos:
- change hard-coded url to backend to environment-based declarations
- Learn frontend ðŸ™ƒ
- Optimise the Dockerfile to minimise the image size

A very very very simple frontend adapted from a bun templated project for a Nextjs app.

The only file modified from the template is the /app/page.tsx file.

To install dependencies(at the root of the backend folder):

```bash
bun install
```

To run in development mode (at the root of the backend folder):
```bash
bun dev
```
